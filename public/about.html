<p>Dear Huawei Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Java Developer position for fresh graduates at Huawei Turkey R&D Center. As a recent Computer Engineering graduate from TED University, with a second major in Applied Data Analytics, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to Huawei’s world-class R&D efforts.

Throughout my education and internships at Roketsan, TÜBİTAK, and Promet, I have gained strong experience in backend development, database systems, and software optimization. At Promet, I built scalable Java applications using Spring and Hibernate, and managed data securely through PostgreSQL. Additionally, during my internship at Roketsan, I developed an internal chatbot using Python and Flask that significantly enhanced internal workflows—a project that was highly appreciated by my mentors.

I am eager to bring this combination of software development skills and a passion for continuous learning to Huawei’s innovative team. I am particularly drawn to the dynamic, development-driven culture of Huawei, and I am confident that I will thrive in such an environment while contributing meaningfully to impactful projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the goals of your R&D Center. I am available to work full-time from any of the listed office locations (Ankara, Istanbul, or Izmir).

Sincerely,  
Fatma Nazlı Günay
